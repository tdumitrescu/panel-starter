# Panel starter app

This is a basic standalone [Panel](https://github.com/mixpanel/panel) app, intended to provide a fully-functional starting point for further development.

It provides a working build and polyfill setup with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), allowing you to write modern JavaScript (ES2015) without worrying about browser compatibility. The project includes [Jade](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) templating and client-side routing.

For a more detailed introduction to the app code, see the [tutorial](https://github.com/mixpanel/panel/tree/master/examples/tutorial) in the Panel documentation, which builds the entire app from scratch. For reference documentation, see the [Panel API documentation](http://mixpanel.github.io/panel/).
